Trackey – Project Plan (4-Week Sprint)

Problem Statement & Solution Overview
Train delays are common in India, yet passengers rarely receive real-time updates on current train timings or delay status. This leads to confusion, wasted time, and poor travel decisions.

Solution: Trackey is a web-based application that enables commuters to quickly check current train timings and delay status in real time, helping them make informed and efficient travel decisions.

Target Users: Daily commuters, students, and working professionals.
